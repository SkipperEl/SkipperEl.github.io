An apple at rest
from a tree branch suspended
gravity blocked by
small, naturally imperfect stem
holding it there
potential frozen
locked in stasis until 
<SNAP>
critical mass weighs down
force victorious as potential unleashes
free fall flow
cutting air
microscopic whorls quietly spin off
faint, to twitch
air-current sensitive hair-on-arm
of so-called hairless ape
(which can sense fine things...)
newly published potential realized
and perceived by sentient sensoria
as slight and subtle as it may be
until abruptly interrupted
<THUD>
by ground.
potential to attain the centre
locked once more
brief fall of freedom but a taste
of greater glory that is the
true potential
the new barrier less fragile
yet,
temporary nevertheless.
