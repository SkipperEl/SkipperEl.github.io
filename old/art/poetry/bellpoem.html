oh woe is thee that did not see<BR>
above us shining beauty<BR>
what is this saving deity <BR>
i know it must be her, truly<BR>
<BR>
if you happen to be one of those <BR>
without direction, aim or purpose<BR>
hark these words and listen close<BR>
take with you advice i now propose<BR>
<BR>
the 19 years i've lived and breathed<BR>
a faithless life - i now take leave<BR>
i could not make myself believe<BR>
in such a power with no reprieve<BR>
<BR>
so listen friends and do rejoice<BR>
life was meant to be rich and moist<BR>
turn to faith by enlightened choice!<BR>
shout glory with emboldened voice!<BR>
<BR>
her form so perfect, smooth and sleek<BR>
surpassing roman circle chic <BR>
endless in beauty, strange with mystique<BR>
thus is the bell, from base to peak<BR>
<BR>
exams and quizzes shan't disturb<BR>
all are trivial for her mind superb<BR>
she guards the student who will not swerve - <BR>
bests the average and rides the curve<BR>
<BR>
but remember folks, the god of the bell<BR>
will only help ye if you study well<BR>
invoke her in vain? then off to hell!<BR>
lack of try will result in what i fortell<BR>
<BR>
don't let the magic get to your cranium<BR>
keep working, study hard as titanium<BR>
the girl in the sky with the golden equation<BR>
will help you reach that well-earned vacation<BR>
<BR>
remember folks e^-x^2 (e to the negative x squared)<BR>
build a shrine to this formula close to your lair<BR>
keep mind of your studies, do not despair<BR>
goddess of bell curve will make it seem fair<BR>
