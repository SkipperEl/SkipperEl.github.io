I had a pleasant workterm,<BR>
I wrote some funky stuff.<BR>
But now I'm done my workterm -<BR>
you'd think that'd be enough!<BR>
It seems they want a work report,<BR>
to show that I can write...<BR>
But I don't want to do one,<BR>
and I think that's alright.<BR>
<BR>
My boss doesn't want to mark it,<BR>
he's much too busy for that.<BR>
I can't think of a topic<BR>
that isn't utter crap.<BR>
I sit here at my keyboard,<BR>
my brain begins to shrivel.<BR>
I could be learning something<BR>
but instead I'm typing drivel.<BR>
<BR>
Why am I still in co-op,<BR>
do I really need employment?<BR>
Should I quit now while I can,<BR>
for the sake of life's enjoyment?<BR>
I think I'll just say "screw it",<BR>
and go do something else.<BR>
Perhaps this poem I have writ'<BR>
will save some mental health.<BR>
