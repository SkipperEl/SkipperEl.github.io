[start music] <BR>
neither M nor U but the I between <BR>
the dream of the eye - in the binding darkness <BR>
blinding dark or blinding light? <BR>
good versus evil or pointless fight? <BR>
who is wrong and who is right? <BR>
[pause] <BR>
is it the axiom? <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
or _is_ there an axiom at all? <BR>
if all axiomatic systems are incomplete <BR>
how can everything fit so discrete? <BR>
or _does_ everything fit? <BR>
all systems can be exited - all axioms can be destroyed <BR>
deny the axiom and the meta-axiom approaches <BR>
[pause] <BR>
ctrl-z <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
controlled system or system controlled? <BR>
man-made machine or machine-made man? <BR>
or is the difference even discernible? <BR>
is anyone above the system? <BR>
and if they are, are they free of all axioms? <BR>
is the true god the ultimate axiom or is there even such a thing? <BR>
[pause] <BR>
who made who? <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
the cycle seems ageless, history repeats <BR>
Galileo was not the first and won't be the last <BR>
change comes slow, though discovery may come fast <BR>
but isn't this pattern constant? <BR>
is this then an unbreakable axiom? <BR>
are we in a prison of systems? <BR>
a wise man once said <BR>
"your culture can be your prison" <BR>
[pause] <BR>
are you a prisoner? <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
dogma is as dogma does <BR>
justified action or useless cause? <BR>
can you honestly kill for an axiom? <BR>
who needs a dogma when a dogma can be broken? <BR>
are you sure in your assumptions? <BR>
can you truly be certain? <BR>
you know what heisenberg would say: <BR>
[pause] <BR>
watch out for expanding wavefunctions <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
to not conform is conformity itself - so how does one escape? <BR>
where is the incompleteness - the hole <BR>
how do you reach an abstraction which lies beyond your ability to percieve? <BR>
do we percieve reality - or is reality perception? <BR>
[pause] <BR>
systematic deception? <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
false inspection of the world out there <BR>
t'was the lesson learnt by mr. square <BR>
he heard the voice from directions unseen <BR>
actions performed as if from a dream <BR>
through the walls he travelled <BR>
(or around them, rather) <BR>
if he told you, would you have believed? <BR>
[pause] <BR>
could you shift your paradigm? <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
education comes to mind <BR>
those who don't fall far behind <BR>
to get far in life you must train your brain <BR>
(but be sure not to brainwash) <BR>
is the well trained person better off than the well educated? <BR>
[pause] <BR>
education, not indoctrination <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
many can see the answer in view <BR>
few can actually touch it with their hands <BR>
(proverbial hands, of course) <BR>
fear not fate, for fate is fear <BR>
the future approaches, tomorow is near <BR>
don't just ride the flow <BR>
redirect it <BR>
reverse and twist it <BR>
[pause] <BR>
reality is yours to create. <BR>
[end song] <BR>
