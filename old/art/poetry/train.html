[start music] <BR>
think - it is good for you head  <BR>
ahead of darkness which is the inevitable consequence of ignorance  <BR>
light a candle, push back the shadow  <BR>
[pause]  <BR>
but do not burn down the house  <BR>
[contd]  <BR>
 <BR>
into the shadows - a symbolic link  <BR>
chained to another  <BR>
and another  <BR>
and another  <BR>
like one another - and each other  <BR>
such is a meme - strange as it may seem  <BR>
[pause]  <BR>
but all isn't as it seems  <BR>
[contd]  <BR>
 <BR>
full stream - or streamed socks?  <BR>
full steam - or steamed stalks?  <BR>
brocoli in cream might make you scream  <BR>
[pause]  <BR>
i'd rather eat pizza, personally  <BR>
[contd]  <BR>
 <BR>
food is for the stomache - art is for the soul  <BR>
wealth can be a hole - but all must fill their bowl <BR>
money isn't real - money doesn't feel <BR>
some rats finish first, some rats finish last <BR>
but alas, they are all finished <BR>
the dollar is a shrine to which all are forced to bow their heads <BR>
but which head? <BR>
a man once said: "love never lies - so open your thighs" <BR>
[pause] <BR>
idol worship or idle whoreship? <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
you snooze - you lose <BR>
you schmooze - you win! <BR>
smiling wins you more friends than enemies <BR>
but fake smiles win you fake friends <BR>
what's the interest of a mask? <BR>
is there any personality beneath the persona? <BR>
is it a solid sphere or a holow shell? <BR>
[pause] <BR>
or maybe paper thin plastic? <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
brief interlude - by Wendy Tam <BR>
  "my brain is dead it's filled with lead <BR>
   so I have writer's block, what a shock" <BR>
thus I continue - tick - tock goes the clock <BR>
people who can't stop their talk <BR>
walk in front of the flock <BR>
blind faith is self-imposed blindness <BR>
[pause] <BR>
but ultimately, isn't life itself blind? <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
right or left? centre or extreme? <BR>
coke or pepsi? it's all the same thing. <BR>
based on assumptions, axiomatic in nature. <BR>
but is nature axiomatic? <BR>
why drink cola when one could drink lemon-lime? <BR>
why stick to soft drinks when there's orange juice so fine? <BR>
why merely drink when one could go out to dine? <BR>
[pause] <BR>
but i'm almost out of time... <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
time and space - what's the dif ? <BR>
why are we stuck in our positions so stiff? <BR>
Eris E. would agree - discord is the way to be <BR>
chaos is a form of harmony <BR>
(much like you and me) <BR>
Yog - Sothoth and Azathoth <BR>
would tend to see things similarly <BR>
as would Arthur D. and Ford P. <BR>
thought you know what they say <BR>
[pause] <BR> 
decompression sucks <BR>
[contd] <BR>
 <BR>
i've personally never had the bends <BR>
so it began and thus it ends <BR>
void main() has been called, now I must return <BR>
pop all stacks, finish the burn <BR>
one last thought to you I bring: <BR>
[pause] <BR>
make sure that when you talk, you say something. <BR>
[end song.] <BR>
