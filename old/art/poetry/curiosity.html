What if I noticed you - would you notice me? <BR>
would I catch your eye and hold your thought <BR>
would you pretend not to notice<BR>
or scan by without registering?<BR>
<BR>
what if I looked and smiled, would you smile back?<BR>
with genuine radiance<BR>
would you smirk politely, not to be rude<BR>
or look away to focus on some distant object<BR>
pretending not to see?<BR>
<BR>
what if I spoke to you, would you answer?<BR>
would you speak warmly and caringly<BR>
evasively, not wishing to be bothered<BR>
or with cold remark?<BR>
<BR>
what if I held you, would you hold me?<BR>
in a firm embrace lasting an eternity<BR>
an uncomfortable hug wishing, I'd let go<BR>
or shirk, repulsed?<BR>
<BR>
what if I kissed you, would you kiss me?<BR>
deeply, passionately, so as to lose awareness of the world around<BR>
a forced smile and an insincere peck<BR>
or would you simply push me away?<BR>
<BR>
what if I told you I loved you, would you do the same?<BR>
honestly and truthfully, from the depth of your heart<BR>
would you lie to make me feel good<BR>
or dismiss me with disinterest?<BR>
<BR>
what if?<BR>
Perhaps it is best not to know<BR>
and remain curious.<BR>
