<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><STRONG>A Complete Recounting Of Some Tea-Inspired Chair-Sitting</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P>by Elliott Noel, (C) 1996</P>

<FONT SIZE="+1">
Throughout the day I sit,<BR>
here in my favourite chair,<BR>
ingesting cookies and crackers,<BR>
sipping my English breakfast tea.<BR>
I ponder what is meant by this<BR>
self-induced activity:<BR>
Acknowledging the human desire, the<BR>
need for solitude and self-examination,<BR>
and having noticed the auto-recursive<BR>
character of such activity, I<BR>
realize that I am merely a well<BR>
oiled cog in a greater whole.<BR>
Such are the constraints of<BR>
this supposedly free form.<BR>
It is, however, possible for us to leave the<BR>
closed system if we succeed in<BR>
perceiving ourselves from the<BR>
outside of this entity.  We must<BR>
emancipate ourselves of this<BR>
mechanical rigidity.<BR>
