The first part of the meal<BR>
is often mizo soup<BR>
but don't forget to stir it<BR>
if you're in the loop.<BR>
<BR>
California rolls<BR>
as well as futomaki<BR>
are rather fun to eat<BR>
but watch out for that wasabi!<BR>
<BR>
Okonomiyaki<BR>
is very tasty stuff<BR>
trying to stop eating it<BR>
is often somewhat tough.<BR>
<BR>
Udon is a slippery<BR>
and tricky to eat food<BR>
slurp down all those noodles<BR>
'cause it's not considered rude.<BR>
<BR>
Vegetable tempura<BR>
and shrimp - they all go crunch<BR>
with salmon teriyaki<BR>
it makes the perfect lunch.<BR>
<BR>
Wash it down with sake<BR>
warms me up inside<BR>
the intoxicating flavour<BR>
is a plus i must confide.<BR>
<BR>
Once the meal is over<BR>
when you've had your fill<BR>
thank the friendly waitress<BR>
and then go pay the bill.<BR>
