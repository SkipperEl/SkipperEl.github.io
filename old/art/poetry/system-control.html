Like a vile disease it spreads<BR>
To every city and town all over the world<BR>
In every country - for it knows not any borders<BR>
A new religion waging a holy-war<BR>
It's a battle cry feared by many yet welcomed<BR>
The inevitable destiny wrought by progress.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">
I stop at the same traffic lights day after day<BR>
I live in the system through the morning and afternoon<BR>
Enduring because I am supposed to endure<BR>
Wasting effort and time for no reason<BR>
Other than to be someone's servant<BR>
The destiny which we are supposed to accept.

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">
I observe future managers and technocrats vying for position<BR>
Each one wanting to be the next peon<BR>
Competing against each other so that they may be<BR>
A bigger piece of the system - yet a piece nevertheless<BR>
Substance does not matter - only system<BR>
Self-sustaining and meaningless.

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">
The system is all around us, in many forms<BR>
We live within it as if it's a natural formation<BR>
Where has the meaning gone?<BR>
Why have we lost our direction?<BR>
I want no part in this.<BR>
