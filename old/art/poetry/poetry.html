<P>
  <H3>This is just a little collection of my poetry from early 1997 to present.</H3>

<H4>Insidious sytem</H4>
<P>The first is a little angsty, dedicated to Thomas Axelsson and the rest of the
TPOLM/#daskmig freaks.  The second was inspired (in form) by the book "Godel Escher
Bach - an eternal golden braid" by Douglas R. Hofstadter.  If you haven't read this
yet, do so, NOW.</P>

<H4>The Shrinklit</H4>
<P>A strange project we did in advanced writing class in high school. Basically, a 
shrinklit is a short poem version of a longer or more famous work.  I chose the movie
"Laputa, Castle in the clouds", an anime masterpiece by the well-known animator Myuzaki.</P>

<H4>Other Strangeness</H4>
<P>This poem is one I am extremely proud of - fairly self-explanatory.</P>

<H4>Shad</H4>
<P>These two poems were read as part of the Shad Valley Program at 
Carleton University, Ottawa, 1997.  We had a "talent search" program in
which I read the first poem while my friend played the piano.  The tune
was "so I married an axe-murderer", fairly mellow jazz type stuff.  The
pauses and continuations are for the music, to emphasize certain lines.
The second poem was read as part of our "ca night".  We used the same
tune, in much the same format with continuations and pauses of music.

<H4>Workterm Reports</H4>
<P>Writing one of my workterm reports may not have been fun, but it did inspire some crappy poetry.  Guess it was worth something afterall.  (And MathNews published it!)</P>
