<H3>
Water caustics were implemented in two phases corresponding roughtly to the two parts of the two-pass
algorithm used.  In the first pass, caustic triangles are generated by refracting rays through the water
surface and projecting them onto surfaces underneath.  <BR>
<BR>
To start, solid white triangles were created as new objects in the scene, and the scene rendered normally
to see where the triangles wre going.<BR>
<BR>
The first image shows where these triangles end up when a very low-resolution water mesh (10x10)
used.  The second image is rendered with a higher resolution mesh, but with only a fraction of the 
triangles actually created so that we can see them more clearly.<BR>
<BR>(These images are not anti-aliased).<BR>
