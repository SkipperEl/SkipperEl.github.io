One of the reasons the particular water surface model was chosen was its easy of parameterization
with respect to time.  Fortunately, since rendering the caustic scenes does not take excessive
time, it was possible to make a couple animations.<BR>
<BR>
Two animations are provided, all in MNG format.  They all have 80 frames, and can be played
with the animate command on linux systems.  A delay of 7 or 8 is recommended, e.g.:<BR>
<BR>
animate -delay 7 animationfile.mng<BR>
<BR>
The first is available in 500x500 and 400x400:<BR>
