Now that we can render the caustic triangles in a reasonable ammount of time, we can continue on with higher resolution
water meshes.<BR>
<BR>
The following images are the same scene as before, with progressively more/finer caustic triangles.  The last one has
a 1000x1000 mesh, totalling 2 million caustic triangles.  (Again, these are not anti-aliased.)<BR>

Finally, we enable anti-aliasing:<BR>

While caustics are only generated via a water mesh, the rays are refracted generally.  So, we can put refracting objects
under the surface and generate other kinds of caustics.  In the following scene, a sphere with an index of refraction
higher than the water is rendered, generating a pleasant caustic effect:<BR>
