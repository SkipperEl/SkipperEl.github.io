Anti-aliasing was implemented by supersampling (3 by 3 samples per pixel), averaging the
results (no weighting), and jittering by 1/8th of a pixel.  Below are two pairs of sample
images which illustrate the difference anti-aliasing makes.<BR>

Note how the jagged edges of the polygon vanishe almost entirely, while the curves of the
spheres are much smoother.  I was so taken aback at the difference that I chose to show
this objective first.  From now on, unless otherwise stated, all images are anti-aliased.<BR>

The images on the left are not anti-aliased, those on the right are:<BR>
