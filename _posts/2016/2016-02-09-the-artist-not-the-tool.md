title: The Artist, Not The Tool
---

My introduction to [RedVsBlue] occurred over 10 years ago courtesy of enthusiastic coworkers. Only a season or two existed at the time. I did not continue to follow it afterwards, and largely lost track of it soon after. I came across it recently on Netflix, of all places.

One of the earliest successful instances of [Machinima], RvB was for a time an interesting phenomenon. The creators used the first [Halo] game on the original Xbox to render a surprisingly entertaining story about two opposing groups of space marines. Despite the limitations of the game console and engine, and the consequently primitive visuals and animation, the series was well written and amusing, albeit very silly.

The stark contrast between the limitations the creators worked with compared to the quality of the result reminds me of an earlier example of art emerging from strict constraint. Years prior, a competition was held to see what manner of music could be composed using only simple sine waves. There were a dozen-ish entries, but one shone brighter than the rest: [Stranglehold], by one Jeroen Tel, AKA Wave.

It is said that to ask a photographer what kind of camera they use is to miss the point. I believe this to be true for many domains of creative endeavour.

I still listen to this wonderful piece on occasion, in part to remind myself that I am not fundamentally limited by my access to fancier tools, but my own creativity, effort, and imagination.
