There's something particularly satisfying about a simple, cheap, easy to acquire device that does the job better than the complex, expensive, fancy one. Such is the case of the [AeroPress][Aeropress] coffee maker. A surprisingly elegant way to make an outstanding cup of coffee with minimal fuss. The taste rivals the fanciest of grind-and-brew espresso machines, even in blind taste tests with discerning connoiseurs. 

While I am not myself much of a coffee snob, I have found that I do prefer the taste of an AeroPress cup made by me, to my own liking. It remains superior to any of the other methods I have explored. It is hard to pinpoint the particular special flavour, but it seems to be a pleasant combination of fullness and richness of flavour with minimal bitterness. A properly made espresso is wonderful too, but I still find the AeroPress preferable overall.

Of course, blogs extolling the virtues of this form of coffee making are a dime a dozen, so I won't say much more about it. However, do read [this fascinating article][Aeropress Invention] about the origin of the device, and its inventor, who is also known for inventing.. the Aerobie frisbee. Yes, really. There's also [an interesting interview with said inventor][Interview with inventor] with some helpful advice on tasty coffee-making.
