One of the downsides of becoming older and unhip has been losing touch with the musical world. When I was in high school, I had regular access to a wide range of new and interesting material through multiple vectors. Between [CHMR], the student-run radio station at [Memorial University] in [St. John's], the [mod and demoscene], and, well, my friends, there was a constant influx to explore.

Though I never lost that appetite for music, I did gradually lose touch with those methods of discovery. Recently, thankfully, I've experienced somewhat of a resurgence thanks to [Rdio], [Soundcloud], [Bandcamp], and new coworkers and friends. [Rdio] has been a boon in particular due to working in an "open concept" environment, virtually requiring headphones with music through the day simply to tune out the bustle of the workspace.

One artist I have been introduced to via a friend and now-former coworker is [Penguin Prison]. I'm not really sure what to make of him in general - he composes, sings and produces everything himself as best as I can tell, which is now feasible given modern technology. My initial impression was "Michael Jackson overproduced", oddly - funky and vocal, with a flavouring of 1980's, but modern in production.

There are now some new singles floating around, however I suggest the following trio from the his self-titled album [Penguin Prison]:

* [Don't Fuck With My Money]
* [Golden Train]
* [The Worse It Gets]
