title: An Introduction

Welcome to Random Sequence Of Letters. This space exists to vent ideas from my brain, relieving me (somewhat) of the urge to maintain them. 

Despite my best wishes, I find myself mentally composing blog posts at inconvenient times when I would much rather be thinking about something useful. RSOL is thus an admission of failure of sorts - that these thoughts must be written down so that I may get on with it.

I cannot promise any consistency of quality or frequency of posting, nor any particular area of focus. Technology, business, culture, politics, music, internet memes, nerditry, programming, design - whatever comes up. Since my brain refuses to commit to any particular topic, so must these writings reflect that reality.

Enjoy, if you wish, without obligation. Or don't. It's all good.
